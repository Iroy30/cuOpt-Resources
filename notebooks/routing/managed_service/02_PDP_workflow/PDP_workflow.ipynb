    "This grocery store is gaining popularity and people are placing orders. Instead of doing groceries themselves, they are getting a service like doordash so drivers can pick up their order from a selected grocery store and deliver it to their home address. \n",
    "Now, you're working as an Optimization Scientist in this company. You are given input about the customer's order, including the grocery store from which it must be picked up and their home address to which it must be delivered, their demand, depots, and the available fleet of vehicles. Again, you must calculate a route for each vehicle and ensure all orders are fulfilled while minimizing vehicles' travel time and cost. The same vehicle must handle both the pickup and delivery of the same order, and the pickup of the order must occur prior to the delivery. You can utilize cuOpt once again! All you need to do is read the input data and preprocess the data. Once all the data is ready, you save it to one dictionary and send it to cuOpt, which once again does all the hard computation for you. In this notebook, we will walk through the steps of this example."
