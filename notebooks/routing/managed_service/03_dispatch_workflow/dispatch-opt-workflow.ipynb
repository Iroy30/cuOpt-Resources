    "Finally, suppose you are working at a company for grocery store fridge installation and maintenance. Once again, you are working with the same grocery stores. Some of the grocery stores are new so they have put in a request to install fridges. Some of the stores already have fridges but request some sort of maintenance. Given input data about stores' service requests and the available fleet of vehicles, it is your job to calculate the route for each vehicle such that all service requests are fulfilled while minimizing vehicles' travel time and cost. In this notebook, we will walk through the data preprocessing steps needed in order to utilize cuOpt for this use case. "
